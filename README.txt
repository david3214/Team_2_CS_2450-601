FAQ:
What is Permitted Access?
It is a section of personal information that each individual employee 
can make visible to everyone or keep private to just the admins

Why Can't I Edit My Payment Information?
Only those with administrative access can change sensitive information such as payment information. 
Please contact your manager about changing sensitive information

What if I forgot my password?
Currently in the prototype we do not have a simple way of changing your password.
